# tautologies
A Python script designed to check if a proposition is a logical tautology or not. 

THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN FULLY TESTED. YOU ARE FREE TO USE IT AND TO IMPROVE IT. 
Variables and comments are still in Italian, as it was created quickly and just for fun. 

This program tells if a given logical proposition is a tautology or not. A tautology is a sentece which is always true no matter the value (True or False) of its variables.
Logical operators are considered as it follows: 
- AND: &
- OR: %
- IMPLICAION: >
- DOUBLE IMPLICATION: -
- NOT: !

Variables can be named as you want, but they shall not contain spaces. 
Each sub proposiion should be written between brackets as a mathematical expression, for instance: 
( (A) & (B) ) % (A)
This rule does not apply to negations. For instance: (!A) % (A).
